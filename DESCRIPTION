Description: Contains functions to perform various models and
    methods for test equating (Kolen and Brennan, 2014 
    <doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-0317-7> ; Gonzalez and Wiberg, 2017 
    <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-51824-4> ; von Davier et. al, 2004 
    <doi:10.1007/b97446>). It currently implements the traditional mean, linear 
    and equipercentile equating methods. Both IRT observed-score and true-score 
    equating are also supported, as well as the mean-mean, mean-sigma, Haebara 
    and Stocking-Lord IRT linking methods. It also supports newest methods such 
    that local equating, kernel equating (using Gaussian, logistic, 
    Epanechnikov, uniform and adaptive kernels) with presmoothing, and IRT 
    parameter linking methods based on asymmetric item characteristic functions. 
    Functions to obtain both standard error of equating (SEE) and standard error 
    of equating differences between two equating functions (SEED) are also 
    implemented for the kernel method of equating.
